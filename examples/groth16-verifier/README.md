# Groth16 verifier Example

This example shows how to verify inside the zkVM a Groth16 snark proof over the BN_254 curve,
generated either by Bonsai or by Circom/SnarkJS.

## Quick Start

First, follow the [installation guide] if you don't already have the RISC Zero tools installed.

Then, run the example with:
```bash
RISC0_DEV_MODE=true cargo run --release
```

### Summury
In this example you will learn:
- How to verify a `SnarkReceipt` generated by Bonsai
- How to verify a `Groth16 proof` generated by Circom/SnarkJS. To know more how to generate such a proof follow [this tutorial](https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/proving-circuits/).
- How to prove the verification of a `Groth16 proof` from the zkVM
